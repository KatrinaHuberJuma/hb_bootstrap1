                <h1>Anansi Boys by Neil Gaiman, read by Lenny Henry</h1>

                <p>Another one which I listened to twice (at least), and laughed out loud both times. “Fat Charlie” is the son of a West African trickster god, called Anansi the Spider. Of course, Fat Charlie doesn’t realize that at the beginning of the book. All he knows is that his father, who everyone else finds charming, stands between him and his dreams of normalcy. Fat Charlie grew up the butt of his father’s pranks, constantly embarrassed by his father’s antics. Even his father’s death is a source of embarrassment. And he discovers he has an opposite twin, just as mischievous as his father. You’ll cringe for poor Charlie as his life goes to pieces, but you’ll be glad in the end.</p>
